# Don't know what this is about.

Dear guys, I've no idea what I'm doing here. Just trying some things...

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b44b573ff1c07e04f1c0b93bee35c06929ed03b7.jpg" /><h1>Go Into The Story | The craft of screenwriting, movies, Hollywood, and the creative life</h1><p>BLOOD: Your continued narrow-minded refusal to believe in Over the Hill is possibly costing us a better life, you know. VIC: Over the Hill, my ass. BLOOD: Well, when do we start looking for it again? VIC: Soon as I get my heart started.</p></article>
