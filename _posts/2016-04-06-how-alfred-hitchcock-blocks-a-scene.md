  The Nerdwriter breaks down a scene from Hitchcock's Vertigo to look for story
  clues in the blocking. I'm always troubled by these kinds of "readings" of
  movie scenes for two big reasons: (1) it assumes that Alfred Hitchcock was
  entirely responsible for the blocking and (2) that only Alfred Hitchcock is
  capable of that kind of blocking.
